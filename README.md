<h1>Vegas Checker</h1>
<p>Website coded with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Usage during my volunteer work as soccer coach.</p>
<p>It was for the player to check if their name was included in the traveling list to a soccer tournament we participated in Las Vegas</p>
<p>It refreshed the images to every player accordingly, showing where they would be possibly used during the tournament</p>

<p>To check usage, try any of the following names:"</p>
<ul>
  <li>James</li>
  <li>Alex</li>
  <li>Tyler</li>
</ul>
